# Rental Price Prediction with Different Preprocessing Techniques

This project aims to observe how various preprocessing techniques(basic ones) affect the performance of three different algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest - in predicting rental prices. 

## Introduction
Predicting rental prices accurately is crucial for both tenants and landlords. By employing machine learning algorithms, we can leverage historical rental data to make informed predictions about future rental prices. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms can be influenced by the preprocessing techniques applied to the data.

## Data
see data on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

## Preprocessing Techniques
Several preprocessing techniques have been applied to the dataset before feeding it into the algorithms. These techniques include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Outlier Removal

## Algorithms
Three different algorithms have been employed for rental price prediction:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

## Evaluation
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Cross-Validation Score, and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
